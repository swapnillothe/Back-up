The "top twelve" letters constitute about 80% of the total usage. The "top eight" letters constitute about 65% of the total usage. Letter frequency as a function of rank can be fitted well by several rank functions, with the two-parameter Cocho/Beta rank function being the best.[4] Another rank function with no adjustable free parameter also fits the letter frequency distribution reasonably well[5] (the same function has been used to fit the amino acid frequency in protein sequences.[6]) A spy using the VIC cipher or some other cipher based on a straddling checkerboard typically uses a mnemonic such as "a sin to err" (dropping the second "r")[7][8] or "at one sir"[9] to remember the top eight characters.
